**Thesis goal: empirical insights mining from a large dataset of Airbnb listings that compete in the same market segments with traditional 2-start hotels in New York City (NYC)**

1. The first part focused on analyzing the current pattern of the NYC lodging market and the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings. An exploratory analysis of the Airbnb listings dataset and clustering algorithm performed on socio-economic data to address the following questions:
- How does the number of listings vary by neighborhood clusters?
- How do the prices of listings vary by neighborhood clusters?
- How does demand vary across neighborhood clusters?
- What are the different types of properties in neighborhood clusters? 
- Which locations are rated highly by guests?

2. The second part of this thesis is to leverage large data set of Airbnb customer reviews to help hotel managers understand the current customer’s preference on the accommodation market, using the latest technique in topic modeling: Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to find that there are five hidden lodging aspects in customer reviews: value, location, communication, products/services, experience. Then, analyzing different sentiment nuances expressed in each aspect

- What makes a rental experience good or bad? 
- What are the prominent aspects of the lodging experience that customers care about? 
- What makes the Airbnb experience so special? 
- Are all customers treat each lodging aspect equally?
-	If customer’s preference over aspects is different, how should hoteliers offer the highest level of personalization to satisfy customers?

3. In the final analysis, the author investigates two main pillars of revenue management tactics applied by Airbnb hosts: market segmentation and pricing strategies. K-means clustering algorithm applied on listing’s features such as property characteristics, pricing policies, location, host background, guest background, review ratings, rental policies, and historical availability to identify the current market segments on NYC lodging market and the results indicated that there are four main market segments targeted by Airbnb: ordinary listings offering short-term rental to individual/couple customers, premium listings offering short-term rental to individual/couple customers, short-term rental to customers traveling in a group and long-term rental. Next, the thesis goes further by investigating how Airbnb hosts practice their pricing strategies across the market segment.
